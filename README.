# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

**Project Objective**: Checking the performance of campaigns on different marketing channels among control & experiment groups and also among different age groups and investigate reasons for high performance or underperformance of channels.

**Dataset**: Data is for 1 month (1st-31st January) & important variables are marketing channel, ad display language, user preferred language, age group, subscribing channel etc.

**Methodolgy**: In my analysis I have calculated & plotted conversion rates across channels, age groups, control/experiment group and days of the week to gauge the performance and derive insights. And after that have done A/B testing to validate the inferences/insights.
